![Tumor Volume](pymaceuticals_md/output_10_0.png)

*Capomulin performed the best in tumor reduction being the only drug that actually caused a reduction among the four drugs emphasized.

*Ketapril actually increased Tumor Volume relative to the Placebo.


![Survival](pymaceuticals_md/output_22_0.png)

*Capomulin again outperforms the others with most subjects surviving treatment.
